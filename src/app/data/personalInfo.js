export const professionalSummary = {
    intro: "I'm a Backend Engineer who loves building systems that actually work in the real world. With 2+ years of hands-on experience, I specialize in crafting scalable microservices and RESTful APIs using Java (Spring Boot) and Python (Django REST Framework).",

    story: "My journey into backend development started in college when I built my first REST API for a student project. What began as a simple CRUD application sparked something in me—the thrill of solving complex problems and seeing code transform into real solutions. Fast forward to today, and I've architected multi-tenant Learning Management Systems serving thousands of students, built AI-powered recruitment platforms, and optimized e-commerce backends handling thousands of daily transactions. Each project taught me something new: the importance of clean architecture, the beauty of well-optimized queries, and the satisfaction of deploying code that makes a real difference.",

    expertise: "I specialize in designing robust backend architectures that don't break under pressure. My sweet spot? Taking complex business requirements and translating them into elegant, maintainable code. I've spent countless hours optimizing database queries (achieving up to 40% faster response times), implementing secure authentication systems protecting sensitive data, and building microservices that scale gracefully. Whether it's integrating payment gateways, setting up Redis caching layers, or deploying on AWS, I focus on solutions that are both powerful and sustainable.",

    approach: "I'm a firm believer in the 'measure twice, cut once' philosophy. Before writing a single line of code, I invest time understanding the problem deeply. I write code that my future self (and teammates) won't curse at—clean, documented, and following SOLID principles. I'm also passionate about automation; if I have to do something twice, I'll spend the time building a script to do it forever. Continuous learning is non-negotiable for me—currently exploring Kafka, Kubernetes, and diving deeper into distributed systems.",

    beyond: "When I'm not debugging production issues or optimizing SQL queries, you'll find me experimenting with new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, or mentoring junior developers (because someone once helped me, and I believe in paying it forward). I also enjoy automating everyday tasks—I recently built a browser automation tool using Python and RPA frameworks just for fun. Outside of tech, I'm into exploring new cuisines, reading about system design, and occasionally binge-watching tech talks on YouTube.",

    impact: "Throughout my career, I've integrated 50+ RESTful APIs, deployed production systems serving 1000+ active users, and collaborated with cross-functional teams to ship features that users actually love. I've worked on everything from solo projects where I owned the entire backend to team environments where I contributed to architectural decisions. My proudest achievement? Reducing infrastructure costs by 60% for an educational platform while improving performance—proof that good engineering benefits both users and the bottom line.",

    cta: "I'm currently open to exciting backend engineering opportunities where I can build impactful systems and work with talented teams. If you're working on challenging problems involving scalability, microservices, or distributed systems—let's connect!"
